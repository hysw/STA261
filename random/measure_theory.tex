\section{Measure Theory}

\subsection{Measure zero}
	Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. We say $A$ has \underline{measure zero}
	in $\mathbb{R}^n$ if for every $\epsilon>0$, there is a covering $Q_1, Q_2, \dots$ of $A$
	by countably many rectangles such that
	$\sum_{i=1}^\infty v(Q_i)<\epsilon$.
	\extranote{If this inequality holds, we often say that the \underline{total volume} of the rectangles
	$Q_1, Q_2, \dots$ is less than $\epsilon$.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $B \subseteq A$ and $A$ has measure zero in $\mathbb{R}^n$, the so does B.
  \item Let $A$ be the union of the collection of sets
        $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ If each $A_i$ has measure zero, so does $A$.
  \item A set $A$ has measure zero in $\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only i
